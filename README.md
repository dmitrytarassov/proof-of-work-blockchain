# Simple Blockchain with Proof-of-Work Consensus in TypeScript

## Overview

This project aims to implement a basic blockchain system with Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism using TypeScript. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the working of the PoW algorithm in a simplified environment. This blockchain will support basic transactions and block creation with a simple validation process.

## Features

- **Blockchain Initialization**: Setup of the initial blockchain with a genesis block.
- **Proof-of-Work Consensus**: Implementation of the PoW algorithm to ensure security and consensus across the network.
- **Block Creation**: Ability to add new blocks to the chain after successful mining.
- **Transaction Support**: Basic structure for creating and adding transactions to blocks.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Validation of the integrity of the blockchain at any point in time.
- **Simple API**: A simple API to interact with the blockchain, including creating transactions and viewing the chain.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**: The project is written entirely in TypeScript, providing type safety and the benefits of the latest ECMAScript features.
- **Node.js**: Used for the runtime environment, allowing the blockchain to be run and tested locally.
